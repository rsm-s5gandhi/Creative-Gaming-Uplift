# 🎮 Creative Gaming: Uplift Modeling  

This project applies **uplift modeling and predictive analytics** to gaming datasets, with the objective of **optimizing targeted interventions**—such as new features, rewards, or promotions—and maximizing **player engagement and retention**.  

By leveraging in-game behavioral data and player transaction logs, the analysis demonstrates how **data-driven targeting** can enhance user experience, increase **incremental revenue**, and support smarter decision-making in the competitive gaming industry.

## 📌 Project Overview  
Modern game design and marketing are increasingly data-driven, relying on analytics to **personalize experiences and campaigns**.  
A central challenge: **Which players should be targeted with new features or incentives?**  
- Over-targeting → wasted resources and disengagement.  
- Under-targeting → missed opportunities for growth.  

This project uses **uplift modeling**, a technique that estimates the **incremental impact** of an intervention (e.g., reward, event, feature introduction), rather than simply predicting who will engage.  

**Key question addressed:**  
👉 *Which players are most likely to increase engagement or spending if targeted?*  

**Objectives:**  
1. Prepare and analyze experimental treatment vs control datasets.  
2. Build baseline **propensity models** and advanced **uplift models**.  
3. Compare models on effectiveness using uplift metrics.  
4. Simulate campaign targeting strategies and quantify incremental profit.  
5. Provide business recommendations for optimizing player retention and monetization.

## 🔍 Methodology  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- **Data Sources:** In-game transactions, session history, player profiles, event logs.  
- **Preprocessing:** Missing value handling, scaling, encoding categorical variables.  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Player lifetime value (LTV)  
  - Playstyle clusters (behavioral segmentation)  
  - Recency, frequency, monetary (RFM) metrics  
  - Prior event and campaign exposure  

---

### 2. Modeling Approach  
- **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forests (propensity to convert).  
- **Uplift Models:**  
  - Two-Model Approach (separate models for treatment & control)  
  - Causal Forests (heterogeneous treatment effects)  
  - Neural Networks & XGBoost for advanced uplift estimation  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Qini Coefficient  
  - AUUC (Area Under the Uplift Curve)  
  - Incremental profit simulations

### 3. Campaign Simulation  
- Compared **three targeting strategies:**  
  - *Mass Targeting* (everyone receives intervention)  
  - *Random Targeting* (baseline strategy)  
  - *Uplift-Driven Targeting* (optimal, based on model predictions)  
- Quantified the **incremental impact** of each approach.  
- Demonstrated that uplift modeling significantly **outperforms propensity models** in allocating marketing resources and maximizing ROI.

## 🚀 Key Takeaways  
- Uplift modeling identifies **who benefits most from interventions**, not just who is likely to convert.  
- **Incremental targeting** ensures resources are focused on players with the highest net gain.  
- Compared to propensity models, uplift modeling delivers **higher profitability and customer satisfaction**.  
- This approach can guide **reward systems, promotional campaigns, and feature rollouts** in the gaming industry.
