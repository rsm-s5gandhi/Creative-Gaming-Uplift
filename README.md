# 📊 Customer Analytics – Uplift Modeling for Targeted Marketing Campaigns

This project explores the application of uplift modeling and predictive analytics to customer datasets, with the goal of optimizing marketing campaign targeting and maximizing return on investment (ROI). By leveraging transactional and behavioral customer data, the analysis demonstrates how data-driven strategies can enhance engagement, conversion rates, and campaign profitability in a competitive business environment.

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern marketing relies heavily on data to drive decisions and personalize campaigns. One of the major challenges for marketers is determining which customers to target with offers or promotions: excessive targeting can lead to customer fatigue, while insufficient targeting may leave revenue opportunities unclaimed.

This project utilizes uplift modeling—a technique that estimates the incremental impact of a marketing intervention, rather than just predicting who will convert. The key question addressed is: **Which customers are most likely to respond positively to a campaign if targeted?**

## 🔍 Methodology

### Data Preparation

- **Data Sources:** Worked with customer transaction logs, engagement history, and demographic attributes.
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing data, normalized variables, and encoded categorical features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generated new features capturing customer lifetime value, activity clusters, recency/frequency, and prior campaign exposure.

### Modeling Approach

- **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression and Random Forests to estimate conversion probability.
- **Uplift Models:** Applied Causal Forests, Two-Model approaches, and treatment/control group analysis.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Qini coefficient, AUUC (Area Under the Uplift Curve), and incremental profit analysis.

### Campaign Simulation

- Simulated different campaign targeting strategies: mass targeting, random selection, and uplift-driven targeting.
- Quantified the ROI and effectiveness of each approach, highlighting the advantage of uplift modeling for smarter resource allocation.
