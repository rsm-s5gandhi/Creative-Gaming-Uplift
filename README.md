# 🎮 Creative Gaming Uplift Modeling

This project applies uplift modeling and predictive analytics to gaming datasets, with the objective of optimizing targeted interventions—such as new features, rewards, or promotions—and maximizing player engagement and retention. By leveraging in-game behavioral data and player transaction logs, the analysis demonstrates how data-driven strategies can enhance user experience, increase incremental revenue, and support smarter decision-making in the competitive gaming industry.

## 📌 Project Overview

Modern game design and marketing are increasingly data-driven, relying on analytics to personalize experiences and campaigns. A central challenge is determining which players to target with new features or incentives: over-targeting can lead to disengagement, while under-targeting may miss opportunities for growth.

This project utilizes **uplift modeling**—a technique that estimates the incremental impact of a gaming intervention (such as a reward, event, or feature introduction), rather than merely predicting who will engage. The key question addressed is: **Which players are most likely to show increased engagement or spending if targeted?**

## 🔍 Methodology

### Data Preparation

- **Data Sources:** In-game transaction records, session history, player profiles, and event logs.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, scaling variables, and encoding categorical features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generating features such as lifetime value, playstyle clusters, recency/frequency metrics, and prior event exposure.

### Modeling Approach

- **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression and Random Forests for engagement/conversion probability.
- **Uplift Models:** Causal Forests, Two-Model approaches, and treatment/control group analysis tailored for gaming interventions.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Qini coefficient, AUUC (Area Under the Uplift Curve), and incremental profit analysis.

### Campaign Simulation

- Simulated strategies for feature rollout and reward targeting: mass targeting, random selection, and uplift-driven targeting.
- Quantified the incremental impact and effectiveness of each approach, highlighting the advantage of uplift modeling for allocating resources and maximizing player satisfaction.
